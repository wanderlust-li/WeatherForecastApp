### 🌦️ About

The Weather Forecast App is a robust weather web application that lets users retrieve weather information based on their inputs. The application leverages the power of ASP.NET Core MVC .NET 7.0 and Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) to handle and store data efficiently. Weather data is sourced through an API from [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/).
